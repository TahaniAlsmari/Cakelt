# Cakelt - Custom Cake Ordering App
**Software Engineering Project | Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University**

## 📌 Project Overview
**Cakelt** is a specialized mobile application for a cake shop that bridges the gap between traditional bakeries and digital customization. It allows users to design their own cakes (flavors, fillings, decorations) and see a visual preview before ordering[.

### 🛠 The Problem We Solve
* **Limited Customization:** Traditional stores have fixed designs.
* **Communication Gap:** Ordering custom cakes via calls often leads to errors.
* **No Preview:** Customers cannot visualize their design before it's made.
