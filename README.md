## Project Overview
The core objective of Cakelt is to bridge the communication gap between customers and bakers. By digitizing the customization process, the application ensures accuracy in orders, reduces manual errors, and enhances customer satisfaction through a modern design-to-order workflow.

## Development Methodology
The project followed structured software engineering principles:
1. **Analysis:** Requirements gathering and prioritization.
2. **Modeling:** Using UML diagrams to visualize system logic.
3. **Design:** High-fidelity prototyping of user interfaces.
